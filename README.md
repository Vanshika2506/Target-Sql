Target Corporation (doing business as Target and stylized as Target) is an American big box department store
chain headquartered in Minneapolis,Minnesota.It is the seventh largest retailer in the US.Target was established
as the discount division of Dayton's department store of Minneapolis in 1962.

The case study is an exploration , wherein we have to analyse patterns of customer and seller behaviour based on 
their geolocation ,payment methods,reviews,timely delivery etc. I created this project using SQL and Tableau.
